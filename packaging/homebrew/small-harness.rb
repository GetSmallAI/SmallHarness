# Homebrew formula template / reference for Small Harness.
#
# Publishing is AUTOMATED. On every `vX.Y.Z` tag, the release workflow
# (.github/workflows/release.yml) builds the tarballs, creates the GitHub
# release, and then regenerates `Formula/small-harness.rb` in the
# `getsmallai/homebrew-tap` repo with the new version + checksums and pushes
# it. That step requires a `TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` repo secret — a fine-grained PAT
# with `contents: write` on the tap repo. Without the secret the step is
# skipped and the release still publishes.
#
# This file is kept as a reference and manual fallback: to bump the tap by
# hand, copy it into the tap repo and set `version` + the two `sha256` values
# from the release's SHA256SUMS. Users install with
# `brew install getsmallai/tap/small-harness`.
#
# Notes:
#   - This formula installs a pre-built binary, not a Cargo build, so users
#     don't need a Rust toolchain to install.
#   - If you decide later to submit to homebrew-core instead, the formula
#     shape mostly carries over; homebrew-core may require a from-source
#     build path as well.
